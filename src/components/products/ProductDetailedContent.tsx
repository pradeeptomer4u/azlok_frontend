Early Ayurvedic texts like Sushruta Samhita mention "Haridra" for treating skin diseases and infections. Ancient traders carried turmeric along the spice routes to Southeast Asia and the Middle East. Its bright golden hue made it both sacred and symbolic, earning the title "Golden Spice of India."',
    science: 'Modern science identifies curcumin, the active compound in turmeric, as a powerful antioxidant and anti-inflammatory agent. Studies link it to benefits in arthritis, heart health, and immunity enhancement. In Western medicine, turmeric is researched for its potential in reducing inflammation, aiding liver detoxification, and supporting brain function.

It is used in "Ubtan" (herbal scrubs), healing oils, and golden milk (Haldi Doodh). Ayurvedic healers prescribed it for respiratory issues, digestive health, and wound healing. Even today, a pinch of haldi in milk remains a trusted home remedy across India.',
    modern: 'Turmeric is now a global superfood ‚Äî used in curries, teas, smoothies, and skincare. It&apos;s valued for its natural coloring, taste, and healing touch.
